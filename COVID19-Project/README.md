## Motives 

The impact of COVID-19 would be grossly undermined by any conceivable adjective. The vast majority of us face complete disruption in our daily lives, and some argue it is impossible to return to the way things were. However, there is a recent trend: Starting from early May of 2020, the degree of COVID-19's transmission prevention become a political statement of individuals and institutions. Namely, the protest for defying Stay At Home Orders at the Michigan Capital precursed the now partisan stance on opening the economy. Gradually, the contrary views between COVID-19's low death rate and its high transmission rate obscure our justification for a "correct" response to the pandemic. As a result, peers around me, along with the rest of the world, display opposite behaviors: some have been eagerly going out to bars, and others have only seen sunlight once a week for on grocery trips. My observation narrows down to 2 research questions. First, how much is the state government responsible for implementing social distancing policies based on its unique situation and parameter, and second, how should the trend of COVID19 in San Diego mandate our levels of social distancing. 


This Folder contains Jupyter Notebook files that analyzes the research questions. Will update every Friday.
