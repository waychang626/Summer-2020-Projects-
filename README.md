Personal Data Analysis and Science Projects 

## Introduction 
The US saw its greatest economic and social ripple in recent history in COVID19 and the BLM Protests. With mainstream media, both in the left and the right, so engrained in their clickbait, instant-gratifying profit model, facts are often mudded by biased narratives. Personally, I strive to be a vocal advocate of my beliefs on urgant social and political matters, but I often find myself surrounded in falsified and ill-represented statistics. Along with my desire to create data analysis and data science projects of my own, I am passionate about serving accurate statistical evidence as focal points to my understanding of timely social issues.
