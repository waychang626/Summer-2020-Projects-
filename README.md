Personal Data Analysis and Science Projects 

## Introduction 
The US saw its greatest economic and social ripple in recent history in COVID19 and the BLM Protests. With mainstream media, both in the left and the right, so engrained in their clickbait, instant-gratifying profit model, facts are often mudded by biased narratives. Personally, I strive to be a vocal advocate of my beliefs on urgant social and political matters, but I often find myself surrounded in falsified and ill-represented statistics. Along with my desire to create data analysis and data science projects of my own, I am passionate about serving accurate statistical evidence as focal points to my understanding of timely social issues. 

I will focus on three main topics, COVID19, BLM, and music. 

## Motives 

The impact of COVID would be grossly underminded by any conceivable adjective. The vast majority of us face complete disruption in our daily lives, and some argue it is impossible to return to normal. However, there is a recent trend, starting from early May of 2020, that saw the degree of COVID19's transmission prevention become a political statement of individuals and institutions. Namely, the protest for defying Stay At Home Orders at the Michigan Capital precursed the now partisan stance on opening the economy. Gradually, the contrary views between COVID19's low death rate and its high transmission rate obscure our justification for a "correct" response to the pandemic. As a result, peers around me, along with the rest of the world, display opposite behaviors: some have been eargerly going out to bars, and the others only seeing sunlight once a week for groceries. My observation narrows down to 2 research questions. First, how much is the state government responsible for implementing social distancing policies based on its unique situation and parameter, and second, how should the trend of COVID19 in San Diego mandate our levels of social distancing. 

So long has systemic racism been an underlying hypocricy in the US. Claiming to be the "Land of the Free", our lawmakers throughout history have consistently marginalized minority groups into suppressed economic and social groups by implementing malcontent policies like gerrymandering, voting suppression, and police brutality. Otherwise devoid of mass public interest, the controversy of these politics recently resurfaced with the nation-wide protests for the death of George Floyd and the international Black Lives Matter movement. The counter movement, known as the All Lives Matter movement, claims that brutality from the police represents only the misconduct of a few, and rejects the notion that systemic racism is engrained in the criminal justice system. For this, I am interested in the research question of how much of a factor does state partisanship contribute its police brutality.
