# Summer-2020-Projects-
Personal Data Analysis and Science Projects 

## Introduction 
The US saw its greatest economic and social ripple in recent history with the COVID-19 pandemic and the BLM Protests. With mainstream media, both from in the left and right, so engrained in their clickbait and instant-gratifying profit model, facts are often muddied by biased narratives. I strive to be a vocal advocate of my beliefs on urgant social and political matters, but I've often found myself surrounded in biased, falsified, or outright ill-represented statistics about this matter. Along with my desire to create data analysis and data science related projects of my own, I am passionate about serving accurate statistical evidence as focal points to my understanding of timely social issues. 

I will focus on two main topics, COVID19 and Police Brutality 


## Timeline 
Will start uploading data analysis results by Monday, 6/29/20
