## Motive 
Systemic racism has long been an underlying hypocrisy in the US. Claiming to be the "Land of the Free", our lawmakers throughout history have consistently marginalized minority groups into suppressed economic and social groups by implementing policies like gerrymandering, voting suppression, and the now heavily debated topic, police brutality. Otherwise devoid of mass public interest, the controversy of these politics recently resurfaced with the nation-wide protests after the death of George Floyd and the international Black Lives Matter movement. The counter movement, known as the All Lives Matter movement, claims that brutality from the police represents only the misconduct of a few, and rejects the notion that systemic racism is engrained in the criminal justice system. For these reasons, I am interested in two research questions. First, is there excessive use of force by the police in proportion to race, and second, does state partisanship (red state or blue state) factor into its degree of police brutality?
